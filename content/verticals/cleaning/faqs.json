          "question": "How often should I schedule a deep cleaning?",
          "answer": "We recommend a deep cleaning every 3 to 6 months, depending on your household. Homes with pets, children, or allergy sufferers benefit from more frequent deep cleans. Many clients start with a deep clean and then transition to regular recurring service."

        {
          "question": "Do you offer discounts for recurring service?",
