          "question": "How often should my lawn be mowed?",
          "answer": "During peak growing season, weekly mowing is recommended to keep your lawn healthy and looking sharp. In slower seasons, biweekly is usually sufficient. {{businessName}} adjusts the schedule based on growth rates and weather conditions in {{city}}."
        },
        {
          "question": "When should I fertilize my lawn?",

        },
        {
          "question": "How do I get rid of weeds without killing my lawn?",
          "answer": "The best approach combines pre-emergent treatments in early spring, targeted post-emergent applications for existing weeds, and proper lawn care practices that promote thick, healthy turf. A dense, well-maintained lawn is your best long-term defense against weeds."

          "question": "How much water can I save with a drip irrigation system?",

        },
        {
          "question": "How often should my irrigation system be serviced?",
          "answer": "We recommend a full system inspection at least twice per year — once in spring before the growing season and once in fall for winterization. Regular checks catch leaks and broken heads early, preventing water waste and plant damage."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the best time to water my landscape?",
          "answer": "Early morning between 4 AM and 6 AM is ideal. Watering at this time minimizes evaporation, reduces disease risk from wet foliage overnight, and ensures plants have moisture available before the heat of the day. {{businessName}} programs all smart controllers for optimal timing."
