      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "How quickly can you get to my home for an AC repair?",
          "answer": "In most cases, we offer same-day service for AC repairs across the San Antonio metro. During peak summer months (June-August), demand is high, but we prioritize emergency repairs and maintenance plan members always receive priority scheduling."
        },
        {
          "question": "My AC is running but not cooling. What could be wrong?",
          "answer": "Several things can cause this: low refrigerant from a leak, a dirty or frozen evaporator coil, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning thermostat. Our technicians will diagnose the exact cause and provide an upfront quote before starting any work."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is it worth repairing my old AC or should I replace it?",
          "answer": "As a general rule, if your system is over 12-15 years old and the repair costs more than half the price of a new unit, replacement is usually the smarter investment. Newer systems are significantly more efficient — many San Antonio homeowners see their CPS Energy bills drop 30-40% after upgrading."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you charge extra for weekend or evening repairs?",
          "answer": "Maintenance plan members never pay overtime charges. For non-members, we offer competitive rates for after-hours service. We always provide the price upfront before beginning any work, so there are no surprises."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "Do I really need heating service in San Antonio?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. While our winters are mild compared to northern states, San Antonio regularly sees cold fronts that drop temperatures into the 20s and 30s. A functioning heating system is essential for those stretches, especially for families with young children or elderly members."
        },
        {
          "question": "What type of heating system is best for San Antonio?",
          "answer": "For most San Antonio homes, a heat pump is the most efficient option because it provides both heating and cooling. However, homes with existing gas lines may benefit from a high-efficiency gas furnace. We'll evaluate your home and help you choose the best option for your situation and budget."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I know if my furnace is safe?",
          "answer": "Warning signs include a yellow or flickering pilot light (should be blue), unusual odors when the system runs, excessive soot around the unit, or frequent headaches when the heater is on. We perform carbon monoxide testing on every gas furnace repair and recommend annual safety inspections."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "How often should I have my HVAC system serviced?",
          "answer": "We recommend twice a year: once in spring before AC season and once in fall before heating season. In San Antonio, the spring tune-up is especially important — our long, hot summers put serious demand on your AC system, and catching issues early prevents breakdowns during peak heat."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does a maintenance visit include?",
          "answer": "Our comprehensive tune-up includes checking refrigerant levels, cleaning condenser and evaporator coils, inspecting and tightening electrical connections, lubricating moving parts, checking the condensate drain, testing thermostat calibration, and inspecting ductwork for leaks."
        },
        {
          "question": "How often should I change my air filter?",
          "answer": "In San Antonio, we recommend changing standard 1-inch filters every 30-60 days, especially during heavy-use months (May-September). Homes with pets, allergies, or near construction should change them monthly. If you use a 4-inch media filter, every 3-6 months is usually sufficient."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the benefits of a maintenance plan?",
          "answer": "Plan members receive two annual tune-ups, priority scheduling during peak season, 15% off all repairs, no overtime charges, and extended equipment life. Most members save more on their first repair than the annual plan costs. It also keeps your manufacturer warranty valid."
