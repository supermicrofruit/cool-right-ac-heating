          "question": "Why do my lights flicker?",
          "answer": "Flickering lights can indicate loose connections, overloaded circuits, or problems at the panel. While sometimes minor, persistent flickering should be checked—it can indicate fire hazards."

        {
          "question": "Why does my breaker keep tripping?",
          "answer": "Breakers trip when circuits are overloaded or there's a short circuit. If one breaker trips repeatedly, it may need to be replaced or the circuit may need to be split. This shouldn't be ignored."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is a burning smell from an outlet dangerous?",
          "answer": "Yes! A burning smell indicates an electrical problem that could cause a fire. Turn off the circuit at the panel and call us immediately. Don't use the outlet until it's been inspected."

        {
          "question": "How long does a panel upgrade take?",
          "answer": "Most panel upgrades are completed in one day. The power will be off for 4-8 hours during the upgrade. We'll coordinate with your utility company for temporary disconnection."

        {
          "question": "What's the difference between Level 1 and Level 2 charging?",
          "answer": "Level 1 uses a standard 120V outlet and adds about 4-5 miles of range per hour. Level 2 uses a 240V circuit and adds 25-30 miles per hour. Most EV owners prefer Level 2 for overnight charging."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does my panel support an EV charger?",
          "answer": "EV chargers typically need a 50-amp dedicated circuit. We'll assess your panel's capacity and recommend any needed upgrades. Many homes can add a charger without panel upgrades."
